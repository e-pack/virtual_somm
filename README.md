How natural language processing can help find the perfect wine

The world of wine is fascinating.  The variety of flavors that winemakers can extract from grapes never ceases to amaze me.  However, I find that walking into a wine store immensely intimidating because, among the aisle of bottles, the paradox of choice is in full effect. Even if I know what flavors I want in a wine, I donâ€™t know where to start.  Through this exercise, I wanted to learn more about how wine is described and gain some insight into why I like the wines that I do.
