It is the freshness that dominates the finish with a lightfooted dance that belies the inherent intensity.

Vivid sweetness is countered by wonderfully citric freshness while a white pepperiness shimmers around the edges, adding lovely spice and tingle to this experience. Simply wonderful and so balanced and pure. ', 'Anne Krebiehl\\xa0MW'], ['The third vintage of Tom Cullity is the best to date.
