There is compelling density to the palate, which offers flavors of espresso, cocoa, charred toast and blackberry. Matt Kettmann"
1,Austin Hope 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Paso Robles,"This bottling remains as impressive and delicious as it did upon debut two vintages ago.

Matt Kettmann"
2,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2016 Cask 23 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,"This gorgeous wine combines the best of two historic vineyards—Fay and S.L.V.—into one cohesive, refined whole. A soft entry of woody spice and toasted oak leads the way to an expansive midpalate of currant, crushed rock, dried herb and elegant tannins begging for further time in the bottle. Enjoy 2026–2036. Virginie Boone"
3,Obsidian Ridge 2016 Half-Mile Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills),Cabernet Sauvignon,"This layered, complex and polished wine is compelling from the first scent of clove, black plum and black cherry to the rich, saturated flavors and the lingering spiced-plum finish.

Aged for 18 months in all new Hungarian Kadar barrels, it will mature through 2030. Jim Gordon"
4,Chappellet 2015 Pritchard Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a powerfully concentrated and constructed wine, with 14% Petit Verdot and 8% Malbec. Dark, inky and reductive, it offers waves of tar, leather and toasted oak within sinewy tannins.

5,Diamond Creek 2016 Gravelly Meadow Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Cabernet Sauvignon,"From a five-acre section of the vineyard, this classic red is blended with 8% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc. Crushed rock, red fruit and warm baking spices combine around a grippy midpalate of leather, clove and tobacco—the power gracefully persistent. The finish is brambly and bright. Allow this youthful wine to age; enjoy best from 2026–2031. Virginie Boone"
6,Arietta 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Napa Valley,"Sourced predominantly from the Coombsville appellation, this is a stunning, beautifully aromatic wine made with 3% Petit Verdot.

11,Beaulieu Vineyard 2016 Georges De Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,"Thick, concentrated and hugely structured, this wine from the famous site is robust in tannin and oak, with a core of tangy red fruit, both currant and cassis.

12,Wirra Wirra 2016 Dead Ringer Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),Cabernet Sauvignon,"A complex combo of brambly blueberries, cassis, pencil lead, tobacco, game and eucalyptus carry the nose.

Virginie Boone"
163,Obsidian Ridge 2016 Half-Mile Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills),Cabernet Sauvignon,"This layered, complex and polished wine is compelling from the first scent of clove, black plum and black cherry to the rich, saturated flavors and the lingering spiced-plum finish. A warm layer of soft tannins envelops the palate as subtle blackberry and dark-chocolate notes emerge with repeated sipping and linger on the finish.

164,Chappellet 2015 Pritchard Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is a powerfully concentrated and constructed wine, with 14% Petit Verdot and 8% Malbec.

171,Beaulieu Vineyard 2016 Georges De Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,"Thick, concentrated and hugely structured, this wine from the famous site is robust in tannin and oak, with a core of tangy red fruit, both currant and cassis.

172,Wirra Wirra 2016 Dead Ringer Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),Cabernet Sauvignon,"A complex combo of brambly blueberries, cassis, pencil lead, tobacco, game and eucalyptus carry the nose. These flavors flow through to the palate where the oak plays a fairly dominant role at the moment, along with a grip of dusty tannins and drying tannins.

175,Iron + Sand 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Paso Robles,"The black fruit aroma is reserved on the nose of this bottling, allowing violet, stone, loam and a hint of herbs to come to the forefront.

186,Richard Jambon 2016 Cuvée 12M  (Beaujolais-Villages Blanc),Chardonnay,"Aged in wood for 12 months (hence the name of the wine), this is richly textured.

188,Olivier Leflaive 2017  Bâtard-Montrachet,Bâtard-Montrachet,"A blend from four parcels in this famed grand cru, this wine offers a panoply of ripe fruit as well as a dense structure.

195,LaRue 2017 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),Chardonnay,"Owner and winemaker Katy Wilson makes very little of this wine sadly, so stock up if you can.

196,Raumland 2011 Prestige Brut Chardonnay (Germany),Chardonnay,"Flinty and light-footed, this méthode Champenoise Chardonnay sparkling wine offers crisp apple and lemon flavors accented by hints of burnt sugar and brioche.

Acidity comes from the wood aging as well as the fruit to balance this intense wine. It will certainly age, so drink from 2023. Roger Voss"
249,Chanin 2017 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),Chardonnay,"Extremely delicate and pure aromas of lemon, nectarine, gardenia and lily are soft and inviting on the nose of this bottling. The palate sizzles with acidity, offering focused but austere flavors of lemon zest and crushed gravel that surround an immensely chalky core. It will mature well through 2042. Matt Kettmann"
250,Chanin 2017 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),Chardonnay,"Very delicate on the nose, this bottling offers aromas of nectarine, white-melon flesh, a hint of melon rind and light lemon spray. The palate is extremely textural, offering subtle flavors of lemon cream, chalk, lemongrass, ash and Brie rind that will live forever. Drink now through 2042. Matt Kettmann"
251,Gruber Röschitz 2017 Eiswein Chardonnay (Niederösterreich),Chardonnay,"A gorgeous nose reveals subtle notions of candied lemon, musk, fresh and rich yellow apple and an edge of hayflower. The palate is intensely sweet and concentrated but shines with the vivid purity expected of Eiswein. This is a little gem, displaying alluring edges of zesty spice. It is lovely now but certain to last. Drink until 2045. Anne Krebiehl MW"
252,Rusack 2017 Santa Catalina Island Vineyard Chardonnay (California),Chardonnay,"Despite the struggles of growing grapes on mountaintops in the middle of an island, this Chardonnay impresses with aromas of tight lemon peel, nectarine, pineapple and lime leaf. There is a blast of acid on the sip, where seared white-peach and lemon flavors prove fresh and lovely. Matt Kettmann"
253,Sanguis 2015 Loner Le Dauphine Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),Chardonnay,"Clean lines of wet cement, chalk, lime blossom, citrus peel and sandalwood veer into exotic aromatic combinations on the nose of this bottling. There is tremendous tension on the palate, where fine-grained oak tannins uphold the Asian pear, lemon spray and white-rock flavors. Matt Kettmann"
254,Vincent Girardin 2016  Corton-Charlemagne,Corton-Charlemagne,"This wine has both power and wonderful fruit. The tension between the two will result in a magnificent wine in the future. The wine's acidity and apple and citrus flavors are essential elements in the wine's development. It has a way to go, so drink from 2023. Roger Voss"
255,LaRue 2017 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),Chardonnay,"Owner and winemaker Katy Wilson makes very little of this wine sadly, so stock up if you can. Stony mineral and brine figure prominently on entry as a buildup of Meyer lemon, fig and quince define the juicy midpalate of restrained oak and ripeness. Lingering acidity keeps it fresh through a long, spicy finish. Virginie Boone"
256,Raumland 2011 Prestige Brut Chardonnay (Germany),Chardonnay,"Flinty and light-footed, this méthode Champenoise Chardonnay sparkling wine offers crisp apple and lemon flavors accented by hints of burnt sugar and brioche. It's a piercing, persistent wine juxtaposing rich, mouthfilling pétillance against a bristling acidic backbone. Anna Lee C. Iijima"
257,Eden Rift 2017 Terraces Chardonnay (Cienega Valley),Chardonnay,"Crushed white rocks, Asian pear, a touch of butter and a hint of pineapple converge on the nose of this deliciously complex bottling. There is extreme tension on the palate, where lively lemongrass and taut white-fleshed fruit flavors are expertly subtle and will only improve for decades. Drink now through 2037. Matt Kettmann"
258,Olivier Leflaive 2017 Abbaye de Morgeot Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),Chardonnay,"The largest of the premier crus in Chassagne-Montrachet takes its name from the ancient abbey on the site. Rich, structured and blending ripe yellow fruits with intense acidity, the wine is concentrated and ageworthy. Drink from 2022. Roger Voss"
259,Xavier Monnot 2017 Les Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),Chardonnay,"This wine has great potential. Rich white fruits and generous wood aging form elements of a wine that will take time to mature. To contrast, a strong streak of textured minerality highlights the wine's promise. Drink from 2023. Roger Voss"
260,Domaine du Penlois 2017 Chêne du Chatelard  (Beaujolais Blanc),Chardonnay,"Aged for 15 months in wood and bottled in 2019, this offers a good balance between toast and freshness. Wood flavors fully integrate with citrus flavors to produce a balanced wine that is ready to drink. Roger Voss"
261,Robert Perroud 2018 Terres Blanches  (Beaujolais-Villages Blanc),Chardonnay,"Top grower Perroud, based in the Côte de Brouilly, has produced a perfumed Chardonnay. Its acidity and tangy texture are enhanced by the minerality of the chalky soil. Drink the wine now. Roger Voss"
262,Domaine du Granit 2018 Chardonnay  (Beaujolais-Villages Blanc),Chardonnay,"Lightly wood aged, this ripe, spicy wine has touches of toast overlying yellow-fruit flavors. It is rich and smoothly textured, with a good shot of acidity. Drink from 2020. Roger Voss"
263,Domaine Dubost 2017 Lantignié  (Beaujolais-Villages Blanc),Chardonnay,"In this perfumed wine, spice and a touch of wood aging add richness. Balancing white fruits against acidity, this rounded wine from Lantignié near Morgon is lightly structured and ready to drink. Roger Voss"
264,Château Grand' Grange 2017 La Grange Masson  (Beaujolais-Villages Blanc),Chardonnay,"Perfumed with floral touches and hints of honey, this wine is lightly structured. The year in wood has added spice to the fruitiness to produced a sophisticated, ripe wine. Drink from 2020. Roger Voss"
265,Oro Rosso NV Dosaggio Zero Chardonnay (Trento),Chardonnay,"Delicate scents of dried chamomile, brioche and orchard waft out of the glass. Vibrant and linear, the dry palate offers white-peach, dried pineapple and citrus-zest notes alongside bright acidity. Kerin O’Keefe"
266,Richard Jambon 2016 Cuvée 12M  (Beaujolais-Villages Blanc),Chardonnay,"Aged in wood for 12 months (hence the name of the wine), this is richly textured. Its toastiness is unlikely to disappear, although the fruit is now morphing into nutty flavors and acidity. It is a wine for food rather than an aperitif. Roger Voss"

338,Olivier Leflaive 2017 Abbaye de Morgeot Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),Chardonnay,"The largest of the premier crus in Chassagne-Montrachet takes its name from the ancient abbey on the site. Rich, structured and blending ripe yellow fruits with intense acidity, the wine is concentrated and ageworthy. Drink from 2022. Roger Voss"
339,Xavier Monnot 2017 Les Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),Chardonnay,"This wine has great potential. Rich white fruits and generous wood aging form elements of a wine that will take time to mature. To contrast, a strong streak of textured minerality highlights the wine's promise. Drink from 2023. Roger Voss"
340,Domaine du Penlois 2017 Chêne du Chatelard  (Beaujolais Blanc),Chardonnay,"Aged for 15 months in wood and bottled in 2019, this offers a good balance between toast and freshness. Wood flavors fully integrate with citrus flavors to produce a balanced wine that is ready to drink. Roger Voss"
341,Robert Perroud 2018 Terres Blanches  (Beaujolais-Villages Blanc),Chardonnay,"Top grower Perroud, based in the Côte de Brouilly, has produced a perfumed Chardonnay. Its acidity and tangy texture are enhanced by the minerality of the chalky soil. Drink the wine now. Roger Voss"
342,Domaine du Granit 2018 Chardonnay  (Beaujolais-Villages Blanc),Chardonnay,"Lightly wood aged, this ripe, spicy wine has touches of toast overlying yellow-fruit flavors. It is rich and smoothly textured, with a good shot of acidity. Drink from 2020. Roger Voss"
343,Domaine Dubost 2017 Lantignié  (Beaujolais-Villages Blanc),Chardonnay,"In this perfumed wine, spice and a touch of wood aging add richness. Balancing white fruits against acidity, this rounded wine from Lantignié near Morgon is lightly structured and ready to drink. Roger Voss"
344,Château Grand' Grange 2017 La Grange Masson  (Beaujolais-Villages Blanc),Chardonnay,"Perfumed with floral touches and hints of honey, this wine is lightly structured. The year in wood has added spice to the fruitiness to produced a sophisticated, ripe wine. Drink from 2020. Roger Voss"
345,Oro Rosso NV Dosaggio Zero Chardonnay (Trento),Chardonnay,"Delicate scents of dried chamomile, brioche and orchard waft out of the glass. Vibrant and linear, the dry palate offers white-peach, dried pineapple and citrus-zest notes alongside bright acidity. Kerin O’Keefe"
346,Richard Jambon 2016 Cuvée 12M  (Beaujolais-Villages Blanc),Chardonnay,"Aged in wood for 12 months (hence the name of the wine), this is richly textured. Its toastiness is unlikely to disappear, although the fruit is now morphing into nutty flavors and acidity. It is a wine for food rather than an aperitif. Roger Voss"
347,Château du Châtelard 2018 Secret de Chardonnay  (Beaujolais Blanc),Chardonnay,"Bright acidity and touches of spice from wood aging give this wine both ripeness and complexity. With good acidity to guarantee freshness, the wine is balanced and succulently ready to drink. Roger Voss"
348,Olivier Leflaive 2017  Bâtard-Montrachet,Bâtard-Montrachet,"A blend from four parcels in this famed grand cru, this wine offers a panoply of ripe fruit as well as a dense structure. Acidity comes from the wood aging as well as the fruit to balance this intense wine. It will certainly age, so drink from 2023. Roger Voss"
349,Chanin 2017 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),Chardonnay,"Extremely delicate and pure aromas of lemon, nectarine, gardenia and lily are soft and inviting on the nose of this bottling. The palate sizzles with acidity, offering focused but austere flavors of lemon zest and crushed gravel that surround an immensely chalky core. It will mature well through 2042. Matt Kettmann"
350,Chanin 2017 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),Chardonnay,"Very delicate on the nose, this bottling offers aromas of nectarine, white-melon flesh, a hint of melon rind and light lemon spray. The palate is extremely textural, offering subtle flavors of lemon cream, chalk, lemongrass, ash and Brie rind that will live forever. Drink now through 2042. Matt Kettmann"
351,Gruber Röschitz 2017 Eiswein Chardonnay (Niederösterreich),Chardonnay,"A gorgeous nose reveals subtle notions of candied lemon, musk, fresh and rich yellow apple and an edge of hayflower. The palate is intensely sweet and concentrated but shines with the vivid purity expected of Eiswein. This is a little gem, displaying alluring edges of zesty spice. It is lovely now but certain to last. Drink until 2045. Anne Krebiehl MW"
352,Rusack 2017 Santa Catalina Island Vineyard Chardonnay (California),Chardonnay,"Despite the struggles of growing grapes on mountaintops in the middle of an island, this Chardonnay impresses with aromas of tight lemon peel, nectarine, pineapple and lime leaf. There is a blast of acid on the sip, where seared white-peach and lemon flavors prove fresh and lovely. Matt Kettmann"
353,Sanguis 2015 Loner Le Dauphine Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),Chardonnay,"Clean lines of wet cement, chalk, lime blossom, citrus peel and sandalwood veer into exotic aromatic combinations on the nose of this bottling. There is tremendous tension on the palate, where fine-grained oak tannins uphold the Asian pear, lemon spray and white-rock flavors. Matt Kettmann"
354,Vincent Girardin 2016  Corton-Charlemagne,Corton-Charlemagne,"This wine has both power and wonderful fruit. The tension between the two will result in a magnificent wine in the future. The wine's acidity and apple and citrus flavors are essential elements in the wine's development. It has a way to go, so drink from 2023. Roger Voss"
355,LaRue 2017 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),Chardonnay,"Owner and winemaker Katy Wilson makes very little of this wine sadly, so stock up if you can. Stony mineral and brine figure prominently on entry as a buildup of Meyer lemon, fig and quince define the juicy midpalate of restrained oak and ripeness. Lingering acidity keeps it fresh through a long, spicy finish. Virginie Boone"
356,Raumland 2011 Prestige Brut Chardonnay (Germany),Chardonnay,"Flinty and light-footed, this méthode Champenoise Chardonnay sparkling wine offers crisp apple and lemon flavors accented by hints of burnt sugar and brioche. It's a piercing, persistent wine juxtaposing rich, mouthfilling pétillance against a bristling acidic backbone. Anna Lee C. Iijima"
357,Eden Rift 2017 Terraces Chardonnay (Cienega Valley),Chardonnay,"Crushed white rocks, Asian pear, a touch of butter and a hint of pineapple converge on the nose of this deliciously complex bottling.

360,I. Brand & Family 2018 Eden Rift Vineyard Pinot Gris (Cienega Valley),Pinot Gris,"With dynamic and complex expressions like this, it's a wonder why people started stripping the naturally pink hue that Pinot Gris provides. The pinkish orange wine delivers aromas of strawberry sorbet and rosebuds and then opens onto a palate of light raspberry and watermelon. There is ample tannic tension as well. Matt Kettmann"
361,DRNK 2018 Morning Sun Vineyard Pinot Gris (Bennett Valley),Pinot Gris,"Fermented in both amphora and neutral French oak, whole-cluster pressed, this is a light, balanced and floral white from the cool appellation, layered in medium-bodied flavors of green apple and apricot. It shines in lovely acidity and just enough weight. Virginie Boone"
362,Cardwell Hill 2018 Estate Bottled Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,"Even with a price increase this remains a top tier, superb value in Oregon Pinot Gris. Rich, concentrated flavors of Meyer lemon, Honeycrisp apple and peaches with a splash of cream dive deep down through the palate. The intensity is further amped up by perfectly pitched acids, thanks to no malolactic fermentation. Paul Gregutt"
363,Lange 2018 Classique Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,"This is a lovely, lively wine loaded with the flesh and skin of Anjou pear, plus green melon and apple. It's bracing and delicious, with freshness and a vivid, acid-driven mouthfeel. The fruits fairly burst in the mouth. Drink this beauty over the next two years. Paul Gregutt"
364,Authentique 2017 Leisure Skin Contact Pinot Gris (Eola-Amity Hills),Pinot Gris,"This delicious rosé is all Pinot Gris, fermented and aged in a mix of amphorae, concrete egg and neutral oak. Whether you consider it an unusually dark white wine, a rosé or an orange wine, it is undeniably delicious. A bright copper color, it's packed with bold flavors of orange and pear liqueur. Slightly oxidized and already a year older than most rosés, it will reward near-term drinking with floral-citrus aromas, lushly ripened fruit and a finishing hint of toast. Paul Gregutt"
365,Lumen 2017 Sierra Madre Vineyard Pinot Gris (Santa Maria Valley),Pinot Gris,"Aromas of peach, chamomile, lemongrass and wax make for a complex entry to this bottling. The palate combines lemon-spray and melon flavors, all wrapped in a sleek texture. Matt Kettmann"
366,Lange 2018 Reserve Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,"The reserve is more serious than the Classique, with less front-loaded fruit and more details of citrus and mineral. Fermented in neutral puncheons and partially aged in concrete egg, it's juicy and tart, with more apple rind than flesh as the principal fruit. Paul Gregutt"
367,Sinor-LaVallee 2018 Pinot Gris (San Luis Obispo County),San Luis Obispo County,"Seared lime, melon rind and wet stone show on the nose of this bottling. There is refreshing crispness to the acid-driven palate, where limey flavors are wrapped in a chalky tension and finish with a hint of flint. Matt Kettmann"
368,Fullerton 2018 Three Otters Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,"This aromatic wine entices with scents of graham cracker, honey and beeswax. Lovely in the mouth, it brings ripe apple, pear and highlights of clover and honeycomb. The length and texture are exceptional. Paul Gregutt"
369,Left Coast 2018 The Orchard Estate Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,"This wine is replete with bright flavors of lemon, lime and grapefruit. Accents of spicy white pepper and citrus oil add texture and length. Paul Gregutt"
370,Navarro 2018 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley),Anderson Valley,"Ripe and lively apple and pear flavors seem to light up this medium-bodied, fresh and well-balanced wine. It has a citrus tang supporting peach and crisp apple notes, and will be a perfect aperitif or pairing with seafood. Jim Gordon"
371,A to Z 2018 Pinot Gris (Oregon),Oregon,"This widely available wine offers immaculate fruit flavors of apple, pear and melon that carry through to the full-bodied palate. It shows impeccable balance from bright acidity and nice length. Paul Gregutt"
372,Alexana 2018 Terroir Series Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,"A fruit-powered wine, this is loaded with apple, melon and pear, and dusted with a dash of white pepper. A suggestion of fresh tarragon adds depth, though taken as a whole it's a wide-open, generous wine that should be enjoyed over the next couple of years. Paul Gregutt"
373,Saint Gregory 2016 Pinot Gris (Mendocino County),Mendocino County,"This is an extra spicy, barrel-fermented and lees-aged wine that adds hints of ginger, butter and vanilla to the naturally fruity flavors of the grapes. Medium to full body and a rich creamy texture give it a mouthfilling presence. Jim Gordon"
374,Carlton Cellars 2018 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Willamette Valley,"A light, clean, fresh wine, this opens with scents of calla lily, then brings light pear fruit flavors with a touch of almond. It's perfect as an accompaniment to light seafood dishes, with plenty of acid and a spicy kick to the finish. Paul Gregutt"
375,Château Bianca 2018 Pinot Gris (Van Duzer Corridor),Van Duzer Corridor,"A nice effort, fresh and leesy, this fills the palate with clean pear and apple fruit. It has nice texture as well, as the wine continues into a medium-long refreshing finish tinged with Mandarin orange and citrus rind. Paul Gregutt"
376,Terra d'Oro 2018 Pinot Grigio (Clarksburg),Clarksburg,"This wine smells gorgeously fruity, tastes ripe and pure like freshly cut apples and Bosc pears, and has a good crisp texture balanced by medium body. A touch of sweetness emerges on the finish. Jim Gordon"
377,Punt Road 2018 Airlie Bank Gris Fermented on Skins Pinot Gris (Yarra Valley),Pinot Gris,"This Pinot Gris remains on its skins for three months, resulting in a salmon hue. It bursts with aromas of cherry, blossoms, watermelon and fistfuls of fresh herbs. Crisp, tart and textured, this combination carries through to the finish. Christina Pickard"
378,Cloudveil 2018 Pinot Gris (Oregon),Oregon,"The aromas pop, with notes of kiwi, flowers and nectarine. Off-dry drinking kiwi and pineapple flavors follow, with enough acidity to stand it up straight. It's a sure-fire crowd-pleaser. Sean P. Sullivan"
379,Tamarack Cellars 2018 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),Columbia Valley (WA),"Pear and apple aromas are followed by full-bodied, textured, drawn out flavors. It's a spot-on example of the variety. Sean P. Sullivan"

433,Saint Gregory 2016 Pinot Gris (Mendocino County),Mendocino County,"This is an extra spicy, barrel-fermented and lees-aged wine that adds hints of ginger, butter and vanilla to the naturally fruity flavors of the grapes. Medium to full body and a rich creamy texture give it a mouthfilling presence. Jim Gordon"
434,Carlton Cellars 2018 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Willamette Valley,"A light, clean, fresh wine, this opens with scents of calla lily, then brings light pear fruit flavors with a touch of almond. It's perfect as an accompaniment to light seafood dishes, with plenty of acid and a spicy kick to the finish. Paul Gregutt"
435,Château Bianca 2018 Pinot Gris (Van Duzer Corridor),Van Duzer Corridor,"A nice effort, fresh and leesy, this fills the palate with clean pear and apple fruit. It has nice texture as well, as the wine continues into a medium-long refreshing finish tinged with Mandarin orange and citrus rind. Paul Gregutt"
436,Terra d'Oro 2018 Pinot Grigio (Clarksburg),Clarksburg,"This wine smells gorgeously fruity, tastes ripe and pure like freshly cut apples and Bosc pears, and has a good crisp texture balanced by medium body. A touch of sweetness emerges on the finish. Jim Gordon"
437,Punt Road 2018 Airlie Bank Gris Fermented on Skins Pinot Gris (Yarra Valley),Pinot Gris,"This Pinot Gris remains on its skins for three months, resulting in a salmon hue. It bursts with aromas of cherry, blossoms, watermelon and fistfuls of fresh herbs. Crisp, tart and textured, this combination carries through to the finish. Christina Pickard"
438,Cloudveil 2018 Pinot Gris (Oregon),Oregon,"The aromas pop, with notes of kiwi, flowers and nectarine. Off-dry drinking kiwi and pineapple flavors follow, with enough acidity to stand it up straight. It's a sure-fire crowd-pleaser. Sean P. Sullivan"
439,Tamarack Cellars 2018 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),Columbia Valley (WA),"Pear and apple aromas are followed by full-bodied, textured, drawn out flavors. It's a spot-on example of the variety. Sean P. Sullivan"
440,I. Brand & Family 2018 Eden Rift Vineyard Pinot Gris (Cienega Valley),Pinot Gris,"With dynamic and complex expressions like this, it's a wonder why people started stripping the naturally pink hue that Pinot Gris provides. The pinkish orange wine delivers aromas of strawberry sorbet and rosebuds and then opens onto a palate of light raspberry and watermelon. There is ample tannic tension as well. Matt Kettmann"
441,DRNK 2018 Morning Sun Vineyard Pinot Gris (Bennett Valley),Pinot Gris,"Fermented in both amphora and neutral French oak, whole-cluster pressed, this is a light, balanced and floral white from the cool appellation, layered in medium-bodied flavors of green apple and apricot. It shines in lovely acidity and just enough weight. Virginie Boone"
442,Cardwell Hill 2018 Estate Bottled Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,"Even with a price increase this remains a top tier, superb value in Oregon Pinot Gris. Rich, concentrated flavors of Meyer lemon, Honeycrisp apple and peaches with a splash of cream dive deep down through the palate. The intensity is further amped up by perfectly pitched acids, thanks to no malolactic fermentation. Paul Gregutt"
443,Lange 2018 Classique Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,"This is a lovely, lively wine loaded with the flesh and skin of Anjou pear, plus green melon and apple. It's bracing and delicious, with freshness and a vivid, acid-driven mouthfeel. The fruits fairly burst in the mouth. Drink this beauty over the next two years. Paul Gregutt"
444,Authentique 2017 Leisure Skin Contact Pinot Gris (Eola-Amity Hills),Pinot Gris,"This delicious rosé is all Pinot Gris, fermented and aged in a mix of amphorae, concrete egg and neutral oak. Whether you consider it an unusually dark white wine, a rosé or an orange wine, it is undeniably delicious. A bright copper color, it's packed with bold flavors of orange and pear liqueur. Slightly oxidized and already a year older than most rosés, it will reward near-term drinking with floral-citrus aromas, lushly ripened fruit and a finishing hint of toast. Paul Gregutt"
445,Lumen 2017 Sierra Madre Vineyard Pinot Gris (Santa Maria Valley),Pinot Gris,"Aromas of peach, chamomile, lemongrass and wax make for a complex entry to this bottling. The palate combines lemon-spray and melon flavors, all wrapped in a sleek texture. Matt Kettmann"
446,Lange 2018 Reserve Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,"The reserve is more serious than the Classique, with less front-loaded fruit and more details of citrus and mineral. Fermented in neutral puncheons and partially aged in concrete egg, it's juicy and tart, with more apple rind than flesh as the principal fruit. Paul Gregutt"
447,Sinor-LaVallee 2018 Pinot Gris (San Luis Obispo County),San Luis Obispo County,"Seared lime, melon rind and wet stone show on the nose of this bottling. There is refreshing crispness to the acid-driven palate, where limey flavors are wrapped in a chalky tension and finish with a hint of flint. Matt Kettmann"
448,Fullerton 2018 Three Otters Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,"This aromatic wine entices with scents of graham cracker, honey and beeswax. Lovely in the mouth, it brings ripe apple, pear and highlights of clover and honeycomb. The length and texture are exceptional. Paul Gregutt"
