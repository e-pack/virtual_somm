it tastes too flavors of plum cherry chocolate and vanilla just never seem quite natural or herbal in clove and thick in tannin this is  simply structured and mediumbodied wine that is beginning to show its saucy berry tomato and rubbery aromas at first smell like soup but later suggest bandaid rubber and latex  snappy tomatoey palate is decent at best while this tastes of green herbs and generic this rich fullbodied wine has  jammy syrupy nature to its fruit that presents as sweet and mild volatility on the nose makes this cab smell  bit like salad dressing  scrubbing palate with rough tannins is backed by saucy plum and berry fruit flavors  screechy palate with rubbery tannic grab makes for  grinding plum and berry aromas suggest animal this cabernet feels fleshy but short on depth herbal plum and berry flavors qualify as lightly green while this is harmless and mostly tasteless on  quiet this is  longaged wine in both barrel and bottle two years each mushroom tobacco and blackolive flavors work well against  burnt green background that provokes the powdery aromas of floral bath soap mix with lightly green plum and currant scents  simple crisp acidic palate is fresh and lean with little depth or substance tart salty plum and currant flavors carry over to  quick this wine is soft and simple in approach fairly priced and tasting of tobacco cedar and stewed plum the ripeness is this is  varietalthick and peppery with  huge presence of oak that makes it hard for the fruit to charcoal aromas and smoky toastedoak flavors dominate this fullbodied and almost aggressively oaky wine relegating its fruit flavors to the rear and bringing rocky chalky notes to the fore the mouthfeel is dry and this is  soft simple and approachable wine priced fairly it has firm herbal tannins and  strong presence of challenging aromas of red cabbage herbal fruit and horse hide raise questions about this cabernet some of which get answered in  good way  strong palate lacks subtlety while meaty plum and blueberry flavors are lightly green before showing black coffee on  hard this  varietal wine is big in flavors of tar and oak with  perfumed hit of cassis and cedar on the nose huge tannins wrap around generously ripe layers of baked black tomato green herb and chemical oak aromas need time to resolve and they do  fair but basic palate is slightly gummy in feel

and dried raspberry and cherry fruit and game flavors follow dipping in the middle with the tannins giving  firm slightly dry aromas of olive graphite herbs tomato leaf and stewed berry fruit are earthy while  jammy syrupy palate with sappy berry flavors is short on freshness and balance although this cabernet has its virtues it tastes of desiccated blueberry with green gritty berry aromas are oaked up and smell of butter wood spice and burnt bread  mediumbodied palate is  touch grinding and bumpy while this cabernet from  warm year is woody tasting with mild green notes as chilean cabs go this should seem the aromas suggest notes of leafy green herbs green pepper  whiff of tire rubber anise scorched earth and black cherry focused pitch black lively fruit flavors follow the acidity and tannin structures are enchanting if the aromas and palate sync it could move this is  nicely made wine offered at  fair pricea lightbodied expression of cassis currant and plum wrapped in tight firm

sauvignon blanc where the vanilla custard nutmeg and spicy woody aromas all but overpower stone fruit characters things improve on the palate which is restrained and manages to avoid overt malolactic creaminess its lifted by crunchy acidity but its not enough to handle all that vanillin oak which lingers in the mouth long after this doesnt succeed as well as the previous year and that could be

searing acidity  slightly bitter herbal note makes up the this is  fairly worked commercial style of sauvignon that hasnt fared well in the difficult vintage that was  sure its got the citrus

this is  vegetal dominated wine showing notes of asparagus and canned peas tropical fruit is there too in the background along with flecks of honey the medium weight palate is grainy textured theres less veg here but theres also less fruit the regions hallmark acidity feels  touch underripe and the flavors end abruptlya slightly odd disjointed briny peach and melon aromas feed into  palate dictated by grabby grapeskin extraction slightly bitter pear and green apple flavors finish flat and with  mild grassy this is  very palehued wine that could on quick glance be mistaken for  glass of water the flavors are relatively watery as well delicate if not overly interesting notes of ripe lime pineapple and green bell pepper the acidity is  little tart and  touch of residual sugar left in the wine offers some fruit weight to counteract it the finish is short and this wine is  little closed in on itself and even with vigorous swirling in glass only squeaks out hints of citrus stone fruit dried herbs and grass acidity on the palate is mouth watering balancing the ripe fruit and herbs but it takes awhile in glass before these characters are initially reductive oniony notes dominate the nose here but they mostly blow off after awhile and then the fruitbowl aromas are given the chance to shine through peach passion fruit grapefruit and touches of vegetal greenness things get  bit harsh on the palate again where sharp acidity bites at the heels of the plump juicy this wine offers  quiet line of peach passion fruit and lime aromas with just the suggestion of green pepper the fruit on the palate is ripe and textured but the acidity feels  little searing and  bit oniony at first aromas of nectarine lime grapefruit and bell pepper soon appear crisp tingly acidity cuts through the fruitiness but it feels disjointed and  little underripe and pale almost watery in color this wine shows its cooler seaside awatere locale by offering  salty character to accompany notes of passion fruit guava snow peas and nettles the palate feels less cohesive with the plush ripe fruit sliced through by racy searing acidity and only just saved by the textural weight of the there are lots of reductive aromas going on hereonions and some feline notesfollowed by rather brash underripe tones of canned green beans and peas and then eventually lime and passion fruit the reduction does dissipate in the glass but give it  little while things improve on the palate where the fruit is tangy the acidity zippy and the mouthfeel chalky  refreshing limey note takes thing out at the buttery woody aromas are out front and dominate the nose on this barrelheavy sb  grabby palate is made stickier by cloying wood tannins while this tastes mostly of wood grain with distant hints
