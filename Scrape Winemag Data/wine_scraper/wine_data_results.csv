Given its birth year, this is a big success; it tastes of pure blackberry and cassis, with smoky oak helping things along. On the finish, this is full and ripe but not overly complex. Drink through 2025. "

It's incredibly minty with a fair lick of green bell pepper, graphite and mineral notes at the fore. Pipe-smoke, wood-spice and currant aromas take up the rear. Tannins are fine, tight and powdery and the acidity is a little sharp. This feels like it needs more time to knit together, despite already having several years of bottle age. Try in 2020 and then drink until 2029. "

Aromas of coffee, chocolate, toast and herb are at the fore. Reserved, chocolatey flavors follow. The barrel influence shows more strongly than the norm for this winery, but it has good stuffing. Best after 2023. "

Cassis bud, freshly tilled soil, chimney and ember aromas are followed by flavorful cherry notes on a deft palate. It shows a surprising amount of structure for the Rocks District. There's also a mouthwatering sense to it that ups the interest along with a long finish. Cabernet from this area is unique and hasn't gotten as much attention as other varieties. "
https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/ashbrook-estate-2013-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-margaret-river/,Hess Collection 2016 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),Cabernet Sauvignon,"This wine may be a Bordeaux blend—with a small amount of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot in the mix—but it's unmistakably Margaret River in style. It's spicy and concentrated, with black-cherry and cassis fruit, tobacco leaf, mint, mocha and graphite and more earthy herbal notes. There's a fair lick of oak influence here too. The palate is powerful but poised, framed by ultrafine herb-and-graphite tannins and lifted by crisp acidity. Still a baby, this fine wine should gain heaps of complexity with time.

https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/stella-bella-2016-cabernet-sauvignon-margaret-river/,Mettler Family Vineyards 2016 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),Cabernet Sauvignon,"Like Leeuwin Estate, Stella Bella lies in the southern part of Margaret River where climes are a little cooler and wines a tad fresher. This approachable red berry and floral example shows a fair lick of toasted, coconut oak but it's tucked in with savory graphite and warm earth tones. The freshness element is especially felt on the palate, where acidity lifts the fruit into crunchiness, cinched by spicy sinewy tannins. The oak does get a bit blocky here but all is forgiven thanks to those interestingly textured tannins and bright fruit. Drink now through 2027. "
https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/the-blending-lab-2016-cabernet-sauvignon-paso-robles/,Pegasus Estate 2016 Quadrille Vogelzang Vineyard Red (Santa Ynez Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,"Deep and dark in the glass, this bottling shows intense blackberry-jam aromas alongside a hint of cedar.

It opens fairly delicately, with aromas of cherries, red currents, licorice, tobacco leaf and graphite, with a touch of olive and peppery wood spice. The palate then comes at you full throttle—acid, oak, tannins, fruit and alcohol—there's nothing shy or demure here. But there's also bags of complexity, regionality and age-worthiness. Drink now, with time in decanter and protein or better yet, wait a decade. "
https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/voyager-estate-2014-cabernet-sauvignon-margaret-river/,Caliza 2016 Companion Red (Central Coast),Cabernet Sauvignon,"This Cab is classic Margaret River from a long-standing estate, offering a plethora of aromas from ripe plums, blackberries and licorice to cedar, pencil lead, olive brine and mint.

With a little Malbec and Petit Verdot in the mix, this Cabernet is classic Margaret River, balancing power and structure with complexity and poise. Evoking the springtime scents of this coastal region, it billows ripe red currents, eucalyptus, sage, beach scrub and sea spray. Set up for aging, tannins are fine and vice-like and the oak is fairly prominent, but all should settle into place with a few more years in bottle. Drink now until 2029. "
https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/gramercy-2016-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-wa/,Di Costanzo 2017 Di Co Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,"Pleasing aromas of cocoa, thyme, dark coffee, graphite and cherry lead to elegant, lip-smacking flavors that still carry a sense of richness. Refined, subtle tannins back it up. Coffee notes linger on the finish. The balance is spot on, and it brings an unabashed sense of deliciousness. "

https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/point-ormond-2014-cabernet-sauvignon-margaret-river/,Sketchbook 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino County),Cabernet Sauvignon,"This is signature Margaret River. A nose of ripe cherries and raspberries is backed by savory spices, eucalyptus, pencil lead, black olives and some floral nuances. The mouthfeel has lovely tension and lift to it, the acidity counteracting the dryness of the powdery tannins that slink around the tongue rather than gripping it. Power and poise are what Margaret River Cabs are all about and this has both in spades, and for an incredible bargain to boot. "
https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/en-garde-2015-touche-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,Hess Collection 2016 The Lion Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),Cabernet Sauvignon,This includes 12% Mount Veeder Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot.

https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/stella-bella-2016-luminosa-cabernet-sauvignon-margaret-river/,Arietta 2016 Quartet Red (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,"The price tag associated with fine wines doesn't always align with quality, but in the case of Stella Bella's Luminosa range, it's worth every penny. The Cab is fragrant combo of blueberries, cherries, florals, soft peppery spice and a streak of something savory and mineral, like sea spray on warm beach pebbles. The tannins are fine, herbal and highly textured, beautifully balancing the juicy silky fruit and returning to its savory side on the finish. Drink now through 2029 and likely beyond. "
https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/leonetti-cellar-2016-cabernet-sauvignon-walla-walla-valley-wa/,Di Costanzo 2017 Montecillo Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Moon Mountain District Sonoma County),Cabernet Sauvignon,"For the first time this wine contains some fruit from the winery's Holy Roller Vineyard.

The palate is all pleasantly dialed back considering the warmth of the vintage and region, with an exquisite acidity and tannin balance. In cooler days, Washington Cabernets sat squarely between California and Bordeaux. This throwback wine does just that. Best after 2025. "

Flavors of toasted apple, melon rind and orange peel abound, with a final lingering impression of cedar-grilled apple and light baking spice. Lovely and well balanced; drink after 2025. "
