Virginie Boone"
3,Obsidian Ridge 2016 Half-Mile Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills),Cabernet Sauvignon,"This layered, complex and polished wine is compelling from the first scent of clove, black plum and black cherry to the rich, saturated flavors and the lingering spiced-plum finish.

12,Wirra Wirra 2016 Dead Ringer Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),Cabernet Sauvignon,"A complex combo of brambly blueberries, cassis, pencil lead, tobacco, game and eucalyptus carry the nose.

16,Four Lanterns 2016 Third Blue Hour Cabernet Sauvignon (Templeton Gap District),Cabernet Sauvignon,"There are immensely dense fruit aromas on the nose of this bottling, where cassis and lilac prove elegant and deep once they emerge from the structured backdrop.

17,Clairault 2016 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),Cabernet Sauvignon,"A vibrant cherry color, this wine delivers bright raspberry and cherry fruit alongside mint, tobacco leaf, pencil lead and fistfuls of wild green herbs.

47,LaRue 2017 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),Chardonnay,"Owner and winemaker Katy Wilson makes very little of this wine sadly, so stock up if you can. Stony mineral and brine figure prominently on entry as a buildup of Meyer lemon, fig and quince define the juicy midpalate of restrained oak and ripeness. Lingering acidity keeps it fresh through a long, spicy finish. Virginie Boone"
48,Raumland 2011 Prestige Brut Chardonnay (Germany),Chardonnay,"Flinty and light-footed, this méthode Champenoise Chardonnay sparkling wine offers crisp apple and lemon flavors accented by hints of burnt sugar and brioche.

49,Eden Rift 2017 Terraces Chardonnay (Cienega Valley),Chardonnay,"Crushed white rocks, Asian pear, a touch of butter and a hint of pineapple converge on the nose of this deliciously complex bottling. There is extreme tension on the palate, where lively lemongrass and taut white-fleshed fruit flavors are expertly subtle and will only improve for decades. Drink now through 2037. Matt Kettmann"
50,Olivier Leflaive 2017 Abbaye de Morgeot Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),Chardonnay,"The largest of the premier crus in Chassagne-Montrachet takes its name from the ancient abbey on the site.

51,Xavier Monnot 2017 Les Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),Chardonnay,"This wine has great potential. Rich white fruits and generous wood aging form elements of a wine that will take time to mature. To contrast, a strong streak of textured minerality highlights the wine's promise. Drink from 2023. Roger Voss"
52,Côtière 2017 La Rinconada Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),Chardonnay,"Clean aromas of yellow peach, roasted pome fruit, light caramel, toast and delicious oak show on the nose of this bottling by Kevin Law.

53,Benovia 2017 Three Sisters Chardonnay (Fort Ross-Seaview),Chardonnay,"This gorgeous wine offers aromas of peach, pear and fluffy brioche on the nose, with a rounded, rich and fleshy palate boasting similar flavors.

54,Olivier Leflaive 2017 Les Folatières Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),Chardonnay,"Farmed biodynamically (as are all the vineyards owned by this producer), two parcels within the premier cru provided grapes for this wine.

55,Smith-Madrone 2016 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Spring Mountain District),Chardonnay,"This gorgeous, acid-driven Chardonnay is made from the producer's dry-farmed estate.

56,Château de Santenay 2017 Les Folatières Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),Chardonnay,"From one of the best known and finest of the many Puligny-Montrachet premier crus, this wine is structured and potentially very fine. Wood-aging acidity balances the ripe white fruit acidity and strong mineral texture. Rich and concentrated, this wine will be ready from 2022. Roger Voss"
57,Arnaud Baillot 2017  Corton-Charlemagne,Corton-Charlemagne,"In this ripe white-wine year, Corton-Charlemagne is especially powerful. This wine's considerable concentration unfurls swathes of rich white fruits filled out with minerality and crispened by acidity. The wine's potential is long term and it shouldn't be touched before 2023. Roger Voss"
58,Vincent Girardin 2016 Les Folatières Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),Chardonnay,"This opulent wine comes from one of the best premier cru vineyards in Puligny.

59,Pascal Clément 2016 Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),Chardonnay,"A structured and mineral wine with warm apricot flavors, this is dense and complex. Wood aging gives spice that is balanced by the creamy texture and finished with a final burst of acidity. Drink the wine from 2021. Roger Voss"

80,I. Brand & Family 2018 Eden Rift Vineyard Pinot Gris (Cienega Valley),Pinot Gris,"With dynamic and complex expressions like this, it's a wonder why people started stripping the naturally pink hue that Pinot Gris provides.

84,Authentique 2017 Leisure Skin Contact Pinot Gris (Eola-Amity Hills),Pinot Gris,"This delicious rosé is all Pinot Gris, fermented and aged in a mix of amphorae, concrete egg and neutral oak. Whether you consider it an unusually dark white wine, a rosé or an orange wine, it is undeniably delicious. A bright copper color, it's packed with bold flavors of orange and pear liqueur. Slightly oxidized and already a year older than most rosés, it will reward near-term drinking with floral-citrus aromas, lushly ripened fruit and a finishing hint of toast. Paul Gregutt"

87,Sinor-LaVallee 2018 Pinot Gris (San Luis Obispo County),San Luis Obispo County,"Seared lime, melon rind and wet stone show on the nose of this bottling.

92,Alexana 2018 Terroir Series Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,"A fruit-powered wine, this is loaded with apple, melon and pear, and dusted with a dash of white pepper. A suggestion of fresh tarragon adds depth, though taken as a whole it's a wide-open, generous wine that should be enjoyed over the next couple of years. Paul Gregutt"
93,Saint Gregory 2016 Pinot Gris (Mendocino County),Mendocino County,"This is an extra spicy, barrel-fermented and lees-aged wine that adds hints of ginger, butter and vanilla to the naturally fruity flavors of the grapes.

94,Carlton Cellars 2018 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Willamette Valley,"A light, clean, fresh wine, this opens with scents of calla lily, then brings light pear fruit flavors with a touch of almond.

100,I. Brand & Family 2018 Eden Rift Vineyard Pinot Gris (Cienega Valley),Pinot Gris,"With dynamic and complex expressions like this, it's a wonder why people started stripping the naturally pink hue that Pinot Gris provides.

191,Kracher 2018 Spätlese Rosé Merlot (Burgenland),Merlot,"An edge of rhubarb plays most subtly on a rounded nose that suggests apple compote.
